  <h1>Welcome to the ester egg hunt!!!</h1>
  <p>For my Project I have decided to do something like eseter egg hunt it is nothing special.</p>
  <p>Every time your presented with a puzzle like you see right now.</p>
  <p>Your goal is to find one thing in that puzzle whitch is this green looking clover üçÄ!!!</p>
  <p>Once you find it you would need to Right click on it and and Open it in a new Window</p>
  <p>Its not a BUG its a feture so you wouldnt accidentally clicked on it while your trying to figure out the puzzle =D</p>
  <p>For this puzzle you would need to drag and drop a lot of ractangles to find lucky clover...</p>
  <p>Good luck and have fun...</p>
